## About

Fly Anywhere fetches data from a Firebase Database, where cheap flight deals are stored. It uses Firebase Authentication to authenticate the users of the app, who then have the ability to subscribe to specific tags that are associated with specific flight deals. Users can also receive notifications about new deals and use a widget that displays their saved deals. This app was built in Java and was the capstone project for the 'Android Developer' Udacity course.
